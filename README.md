# LOL-REBOOT

Is your **League of Legends client** or **Vanguard anti-cheat** constantly crashing, freezing, or refusing to start? These PowerShell scripts help you reset them cleanly and quickly ‚Äî no more hunting down rogue processes or restarting your PC. üí•

## üìÅ Contents

### `ResetLeague.ps1`

Stops all League of Legends-related processes:

* `LeagueClientUx`
* `RiotClientServices`
* `LeagueClient`

Then restarts the Riot and League clients.

### `ResetVGC.ps1`

Stops and restarts the **Vanguard anti-cheat service** (`vgc`).
Perfect if you're having trouble launching **Valorant** due to Vanguard issues.

### `ResetLeague+VGC.ps1`

A combo of both: resets **League** and **Vanguard** at once.

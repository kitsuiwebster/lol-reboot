# LOL-RESET

Your League client, or Vanguard anti-cheat always crashing or bugging out, and it's a pain to reset them cleanly? These scripts are here to save you the hassle. 💥

PowerShell scripts to manage Riot-related processes for League of Legends and Vanguard (VGC).

## 📁 Contents

### `ResetLeague.ps1`

Stops all League of Legends processes:

* `LeagueClientUx`
* `RiotClientServices`
* `LeagueClient`

Then restarts the Riot and League clients.

### `ResetVGC.ps1`

Stops and restarts the Vanguard anti-cheat service (`vgc`).
Useful for fixing issues with Valorant's anti-cheat or restarting it cleanly.

### `ResetLeague+VGC.ps1`

Combines both scripts: resets the League client **and** the Vanguard service.

## ⚡ How to Run

```

> 💡 Replace `Script.ps1` with one of:
>
> * `ResetLeague.ps1`
> * `ResetVGC.ps1`
> * `ResetLeague+VGC.ps1`

> 💡 Replace `Username` by your Windows username.
